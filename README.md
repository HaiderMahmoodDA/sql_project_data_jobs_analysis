# Background:
Driven by a quest to navigate the three major data-roles job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs; depending on data from 2023, focusing on the remote job posts in linkdin.

Data hails from this fantastic  [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying jobs for the three major roles of data?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for thes top-paying jobs?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used:
For my deep dive into the data industry job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis:
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data field job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:
## 1. Top paying Data jobs:
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered for each data major positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in each field.

```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data ____'    -- Used with: Analyst, Scientist, Engineer.
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### For Data Analyst:
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

### For Data Scientist:
- Quantitative Finance Roles that are "Staff" level roles Dominate Top Salaries
which mean Mastering quantitative methods (statistics, econometrics, ML) and business analytics is extremely valuable if you want top-tier salaries.

- being that the top data scientsist jobs with such salarises and such high positions are remote: indicat global remote hiring is now normalized for high-paying data science roles, at least this was the trend in 2023.

- Industry Specialization Boosts Salary
Examples:
Head of Battery Data Science ($300K at Lawrence Harvey) ‚Äî specialization in energy and battery technologies.

- High Salaries Aren't Just for Silicon Valley Anymore
Companies like Demandbase, Teramind, Storm5, and Storm4 are not household tech names like Google or Facebook,
Yet they offer $300K+ salaries.
