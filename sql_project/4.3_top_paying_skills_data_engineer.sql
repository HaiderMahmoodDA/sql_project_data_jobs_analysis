Here's a breakdown of the results for top paying skills for Data Engineer:

- Assembly language developers are the highest-paid â€” extremely rare for data engineers, thus commanding big salaries.

- Rust and Clojure again show that functional and high-efficiency languages are prized.

- Databases and real-time data streaming skills dominate.

- Cloud & API-first thinking (FastAPI, Kafka, Kubernetes) is the new normal for big salaries.

- Soft skills in tooling (e.g., Bitbucket, Zoom) still matter and even show up in top-paid categories.
